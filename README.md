# EfJobR

### Overview
This is a Discord bot, specifically `discord.py`. It runs on weaker CPUs and requires stable internet speeds of over 500 KB/s to be used efficiently. It uses Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite to give dynamics. With this bot, you can easily find recruitment forms for free. Note that it doesn't send messages to the server. Instead, it directly messages you on your PMs. It's protected by encryption. So the person running the program can't directly see what you're doing.

# Features
  - **Dynamic Responses**: Parameters of the LLM are randomised on every message it receives.
  - **Private**: Received and sent messages are not directly visible to the bot's program executor.
